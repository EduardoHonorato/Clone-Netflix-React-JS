# Netflix

I used React JS for build this app.

## Installation

Use the package manager [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to install the all dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
npm install
```

## Usage
After instalation the dependencies, run the command in your terminal

```bash
yarn start or npm start
```
After that, you will see the app opened in your web navigator.

## NOTES

You can see the project in production here [NETFLIX CLONE](https://netflix-clone-eh.netlify.app)
